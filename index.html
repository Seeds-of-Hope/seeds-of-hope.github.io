            <b><i>One seed planted on fertile soil can grow and make the difference.</i></b> Such strong believe is the
            main foundation of the Seeds of Hope - Discipleship Program (SOH); a mentoring and discipleship initiative
            that seeks to strengthen vulnerable children with academic, social skills, and techniques to overcome the
            barriers of their current socioeconomical situation by growing in a relationship of the message of Christ.
            We envision to plant the seeds to create of leaders that encourage others to a life of service in continuous
            cycle of encouragement.
          </p>
          <p class="text-muted">
            One of our main development axes is “Christian Life” through the project coordination of Living the
            Scriptures which is an essential part of every activity we develop under Seeds of Hope. For this reason, the
            core value of the program is discipleship. Discipleship is teaching biblical precepts while modeling and
            guiding others toward living righteously as followers of Jesus Christ. This should be a cyclical
            process—meaning once we are discipled, we are to disciple others, and so on. One of the most important
            characteristics of being a disciple (a student or pupil), is to develop an intimate relationship with God
            through Christ rather than just learning about Him. The Christian structure of the program is developed in a
            way that the children put in practice the biblical lessons they learn from our team. The main goal is to
            establish lasting relationships with children using a Christian perspective of companionship, discipleship,
            and collaboration.

          <p class="text-muted">
            The organizational structure of SOH is leaded by a Board of Directors, which is responsible to coordinate
            the ordinary operation of the program. The functions of the board are supported by the technical
            coordinators, whose roles are divided into six major categories: Christian Life, Communal Engagement,
            Academic Development, Recreational Development, Innovation and Finance. The roles described before are
            currently fulfilled by young leaders from different Central American countries, who have decided to share
            the gifts they have received in our different locations. Nowadays, most of our operations take place at
            Hogar del Niño (Children’s Home) in the city of Chinandega, Nicaragua. Nonetheless our global initiative
            started to spread at a local school in El Progreso, Guatemala and the sponsorship of two missionaries in El
            Salvador.
          </p>

          <p class="text-muted">
            The current leaders of Seeds of Hope are from the countries of Nicaragua, El Salvador, Honduras, Guatemala,
            Panamá and Belize. The unique characteristics of each member complement to create a powerful team with the
            necessary set of skills to push the program and work towards our objectives.

          <p class="text-muted">
            As stated before, <b>the vision of our program is to create a chain of value where the beneficiaries of the
              program continue encouraging others to a life of service. </b> To accomplish our goal, we have developed a
            cyclical process; analogue to the exploration of bases in a baseball game. The first base is building
            trustworthy relationships between staff members, beneficiaries and the overall community. This stage (
            <i><b>being implemented since 2019 which we still are focused on </b> </i>) consists of small projects that
            strengthen convivence. Such actions will help us better understand the needs of the community and the
            personal abilities of each individual. Once the purpose of the first stage have been achieved, we will move
            to the second base: formulation of ideas. During this stage the program will take the role of an idea
            incubator. Beneficiaries will actively contribute with their ideas to help their communities, as we find
            feasible ways to make them true, mainly with academic guidance and skill formation. From there, we run to
            the third base: implementation and materialization. In this stage, the projects previously developed will
            start to be implemented and our beneficiaries will be able to undertake their own actions. The multiplier
            effect that we are looking for will take its course of action. Finally, we will be able to make a home run
            when the individuals involved in the program are able to take the seeds that we have planted in them and
            make them grow inside other people from their community.

            One of the Christian values consists in helping others. This means supporting the children of our
            communities, especially those most in need. This program seeks to encourage others to build lasting
            relationships through education and the formation Christian values of brotherhood in Jesus Christ, which
            will ultimately be the basis of our work. In addition, the program aims to create future leaders of their

            mission as a team is to become guides and coaches for anyone who needs a word of wisdom and guidance so that
